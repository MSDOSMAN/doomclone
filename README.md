### A small doom-inspired minigame written in under a day

This was my first time using raylib and I was writing under a time contraint: do not expect exceptional code - this was just a demo/ proof of concept! With that said, the code does compile and work as intended. If you are building this on your own machine, you will need to replace the resource folder as I did not include it in full here.



NOTE: resources/DOOMDOOM.mp3 was created by Richard Lai and is based off of Andrey Avkhimovich's remake of Andrew Hulshult's *"I Sawed the Demons"*.
